## Background
E-commerce has gradually become an essential part of our daily life. In 2019, China's online consumption accounted for more than 25% of total consumption. Under this situation, taking advantage of the big data generated by online transactions, we can analyze and reasonably predict consumer behavior.</p>
Our team obtained Taobao's consumer behavior data from Tianchi, AliCloud, starting from November 18, 2014 to December 18, 2014. And this dataset includes six basic indicators. Based on that, we derived a series of other indicators which help interprete the consumer behaviors, and performed corresponding data preprocessing. After that, we comprehensively conducted LR, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest. Based on our machine learning models, we are able to interprete and predict consumer behavior well, on December 19, 2014.
## Data
Our data is from Tianchi, AliCloud, starting from November 18, 2014 to December 18, 2014. Inclouding 6 basic indicators, user id, item id, behavior type (Browse, collect, purchase, etc.), user geohash (location), item category and time.</p>
