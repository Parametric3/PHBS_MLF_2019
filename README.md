## Background
E-commerce has gradually become an essential part of our daily life. In 2019, China's online consumption accounted for more than 25% of total consumption. Under this situation, taking advantage of the big data generated by online transactions, we can analyze and reasonably predict consumer behavior.</p>
Our team obtained Taobao's consumer behavior data from Tianchi, AliCloud, starting from **November 18, 2014** to **December 18, 2014.** Based on that, we derived a series of other features which help interprete the consumer behaviors, and performed corresponding data preprocessing. After that, we comprehensively conducted LR, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest. 
## Data
Our data is from Tianchi, AliCloud, starting from November 18, 2014 to December 18, 2014. The original data includ two files. One is about all the users' bahaviors on all the items in that period, inclouding **6 basic indicators**, user id, item id, behavior type (browse, collect, purchase, etc.), user geohash (location), item category and time.</p>
Name|Meaning|Explain
:---:|:---:|:---:
user_id|the unique user identidication|
item_id|the unique item identidication|
behavior_type|the classification of user behavior|browing, collecting, adding into cart and purcahsing, corresponding to 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively
user_geohash|the location of the user|can be null
item_category|the category of one certain item|
time|time when behaving| precised to hour

For example, **141278390,282725298,1,95jnuqm,5027,2014-11-18 08**.</p>
The other file is about all the items, inclouding **3 basic indicators**, item id, item geohash (location), item category.</p>
Name|Meaning|Explain
:---:|:---:|:---:
item_id|the unique item identidication|
item_geohash|the location of the item|can be null
item_category|the category of one certain item|

For example, **117151719,96ulbnj,7350**.</p>

## Overall Analysis
### Problem Type: Classification
**'Prucahse'** correspodning to **'1'**, and **'Not Purchase'** corresponding to **'0'**</p>
Particularity of the problem:
1. The label is not just for one user or one item, but for one user-item pair **(user, item)**, which influence the selection of training set and test set
2. This is multi-period problem. For example, for one user-item pair, its label is derived from the bahevior of 18th, while its features are derived from days before 18th. That is because we can only the past to predict the future.
### Days that really matter
Since we will use the information before 18th to predict the user behavior in 18th, the next question is how many days should be considered. Intuitively, the behavior one month ago definetely has nothing to do with whether the user will buy or not. So this actually a hyperparameter that we should decide first, and then find its best value through fine-tuning. Using $\Delta$ to denote it, and we let $\Delta$ = 2 at first. Later, we will also implement the same preprocessing and model on the datasets with $\Delta$ = 3 and 4 respectively.</p>
### Test Set
Three ways to choose test set:</p>
1. ~~All users and all items:~~

2. ~~Users who have certain behaviors and the items that users has interactions with in the two days before :~~
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/Test_Set_Selection_2.png)
3. For each user who was active before, only condider the items that he has interactions with:

</div>

### Train Set
The basic rules all the same for train set. Two things to consider:</p>
1. As customary, we set the ratio between the training set and the test set to be 4:1. So since we have choose **(16, 17 → 18)** as the test set (before '→', the features of test set; after '→', the labels of the test set), we need to choose another four groups.
2. If we count back from 18th, the abnormal comsumption in 12th, December will distrurb our model greatly, so we need to skip that when choose the train set.

The overall process is shown below, and related data that has been processed is in our [Data](https://github.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/tree/master/Data) folder.

## Feature Generating
All the features can be dicided into two levels:
1. Basic features, which usually involve one indicator in the original file;
2. Interactive features, which involve two or more original indicators.

And for each feature class, like user features, the features it contains can be divided into three types:
1. Satistic features: Obtained by directly counting the number of certain event.
2. Ratio features: Ratio between two satistic features.
3. Time features: Features that involve time.

Note: some ratio-based indicators in this article have missing indicator data because the denominator is 0. For such indicators, the missing value is filled with 0.

### Interactive Features


## Data preprocessing
### Dealing with missing data
We eliminate samples with missing values.
### Standardization
In order to eliminate the model result error caused by the size of the data itself, we standardize the data.
### Imbalanced Sample: Up&downsampling</p>
Through statistics, we have a total of 279,525 samples, while the number of samples with the "label=1"(**'Purchase'**) is only 1,529. The ratio of samples with "label=1" and 'label=0' is around 1:190. In order to eliminate the impact of data imbance on the model results, we upscaled the data with "label=1" and also downscaled the data with "label=0" in the training set. In the end, the ratio of samples with "label=1" and "label=0" is around 1:10.</p>
We need to pay attention that after we 

## Model Building
Since we would like to compare the results of using the first 2/3/4 days' data to predict the next day's purchase behavior, we use three series of data in each model below.
### Part 1: Beneficial Attempts
### 1. Lasso + Logistic Regression</p>
We use L1 regularization to achieve variable selection. In order to reduce dimension, we gradually adjust the value of parameter "C" and there're finally 5 features selected, including:</p>
Features selected|Coefficient|Explanation
:---:|:---:|:---:
1_user activity|3.459e-04|The more active is the user, the more possible for him to buy.
1_number of items related|-2.85615479e-03|The fewer relating items the user interacts with, the more possible for him to buy this particular item.
1_time lag|-2.199e-02| Shorter the time lag between first and last time online, the more possible to buy， probably because the so called ‘consumption impulse’. When the user spends more time viewing the items, he may become more rational and find there’s no need to buy. 
2_item_view|-4.624e-04| The fewer relating items the user view, the more possible for him to buy this particular item.
4_geo_view|-9.380e-06| Contradict to our common sense-- larger the ratio of purchased product number to viewed product number in the area, the more possible to buy. However, as we can see in our model the coefficient is relatively small compared with other features.
(Note: Above results are based on the first 2 days' data. Using the first 3/4 days' data, we get excactly same features, and similiar coefficients.)

We use above five features for modeling and the results are as follows:</p>

Value|2-days|3-days|4-days
:---:|:---:|:---:
Parameter C|0.0000065|0.0000085|
Training accruacy|0.901|0.922|0.925
Test accruacy|0.617|0.591|0.643

The results are not satisfying:
a. We expect the "Interactive Features" to conduct a relatively large effect on purchase behavior, because they reflect the specific relation between the user and items. However, none of them is chosen in the model.</p>
b. The testing accuracy is too low, so do F1-score&Precision&Recall under 5-folds cross-validation.

### 2. PCA + Logistic Regression
After principle components analysis, we find the first principle component can explain nearly all of the variance in the model (99.95% in 2-days data). PCA reflects that our data have serious multicollinearity problem. Here's the structure of the first component in 2-days data.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/PCA.png" height="450" width="650"/>
</div>
As we can see, except for "4_geo_view", which make up 99.15% in the first component, other features only make up a very small poportion.
Afterwards, we apply Logistic Regression to the first component and get following results.</p>
Value|2-days|3-days|4-days
:---:|:---:|:---:
Training accruacy|0.901|0.922|0.925
Test accruacy|0.995|0.591|0.643

We get test accruacy much higher than training, which does not make sense. Checking the confusion matrix, we find the True Positive Rate is really low, that is to say this method tends to classify all the observations into Negative, thus resulting the high test accruacy since the buying behavior is so rare.

The above two methods may not have a good performance considering prediction, however, we get a better understanding of our data through them. Possible explanations for the so far unsatisfactory results:</p>
Logestic Regression is not suitable for our data structure. We consider a large number of features , including large amount of dummy variables, the data structure may be complex, but Logestic Regression is basically a linear model. Besides, reviewing the [Tianchi competition](https://www.csdn.net/article/2014-08-27/2821403-the-top-9-of-ali-bigdata-competition/4),it is widely acknowledged that the logistic regression model has a natural disadvantage compared with the random forest and GBRT for this dataset, which is consistent with our results.</p>

### Part 2: Practical Models
### 1. Random Forest
As a bagging method, Random forest can efficiently help us alleviate overfitting problem, and sort out some important features, eg.'5_Number_of_purchasing', '5_Category_prefernce', '5_Category_purchase_power', '5_Overnight_purchase_pattern'.</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/IF.png" height="400" width="650"/>
</div>
Through 5-folds cross-validation, we get the ROC curve (based on 2-days data).
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/ROC for RF.jpg" height="450" width="650"/>
</div>
Value|2-days|3-days|4-days
:---:|:---:|:---:
Training accruacy|0.9878|0.922|0.925
Test accruacy|0.9874|0.591|0.643
F1 Score|92.98%| |
precision|89.60%| |
recall|96.62%| |

### 2. GBRT (Gradient Boost Regression Tree)--boosting
GBRT adopts the idea of boosting, here are the results.</p>
Value|2-days|3-days|4-days
:---:|:---:|:---:
Training accruacy|0.9625|0.922|0.925
Test accruacy|0.9821|0.591|0.643
F1 Score|80.11%|
precision|83.53%|
recall|76.96%|
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/ROC for GBC.jpg" height="450" width="650"/>
</div>
We can see that the performance of GBRT is not as good as RF.

### Conclusion
As far as we can see, Random Forest a very suitable method for our data.
Using the first two days data to predict the third day is
