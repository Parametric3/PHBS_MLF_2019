## Background
E-commerce has gradually become an essential part of our daily life. In 2019, China's online consumption accounted for more than 25% of total consumption. Under this situation, taking advantage of the big data generated by online transactions, we can analyze and reasonably predict consumer behavior.</p>
Our team obtained Taobao's consumer behavior data from Tianchi, AliCloud, starting from **November 18, 2014** to **December 18, 2014.** And this dataset includes six basic indicators. Based on that, we derived a series of other features which help interprete the consumer behaviors, and performed corresponding data preprocessing. After that, we comprehensively conducted LR, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
