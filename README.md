## 1. Background
E-commerce has gradually become an essential part of our daily life. In 2019, China's online consumption accounted for more than 25% of total consumption. Under this situation, taking advantage of the big data generated by online transactions, we can analyze and reasonably predict consumer behavior.</p>
Our team obtained Taobao's consumer behavior data from Tianchi, AliCloud, starting from **November 18, 2014** to **December 18, 2014.** Based on that, we derived a series of other features which help interprete the consumer behaviors, and performed corresponding data preprocessing. After that, we comprehensively conducted LR, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest. 
## 2. Data
Our data is from Tianchi, AliCloud, starting from November 18, 2014 to December 18, 2014. The original data includ two files. One is named `tianchi_fresh_comp_train_user.csv`, which is about all the users' bahaviors on all the items in that period, inclouding **6 basic indicators**, user id, item id, behavior type (browse, collect, purchase, etc.), user geohash (location), item category and time.</p>
Name|Meaning|Explain
:---:|:---:|:---:
user_id|the unique user identidication|
item_id|the unique item identidication|
behavior_type|the classification of user behavior|browing, collecting, adding into cart and purcahsing, corresponding to 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively
user_geohash|the location of the user|can be null
item_category|the category of one certain item|
time|time when behaving| precised to hour

For example, **141278390,282725298,1,95jnuqm,5027,2014-11-18 08**.</p>
The other file is named `tianchi_fresh_comp_train_item.csv`, which is about all the items, inclouding **3 basic indicators**, item id, item geohash (location), item category.</p>
Name|Meaning|Explain
:---:|:---:|:---:
item_id|the unique item identidication|
item_geohash|the location of the item|can be null
item_category|the category of one certain item|

For example, **117151719,96ulbnj,7350**.</p>

## 3. Overall Analysis
### 3.1 Problem Type: Classification
**'Prucahse'** correspodning to **'1'**, and **'Not Purchase'** corresponding to **'0'**</p>
Particularity of the problem:
1. The label is not just for one user or one item, but for one user-item pair **(user, item)**, which influence the selection of training set and test set
2. This is multi-period problem. For example, for one user-item pair, its label is derived from the bahevior of 18th, while its features are derived from days before 18th. That is because we can only the past to predict the future.
### 3.2 Days that really matter
Since we will use the information before 18th to predict the user behavior in 18th, the next question is how many days should be considered. Intuitively, the behavior one month ago definetely has nothing to do with whether the user will buy or not. So this actually a hyperparameter that we should decide first, and then find its best value through fine-tuning. Using $\Delta$ to denote it, and we let $\Delta$ = 2 at first. Later, we will also implement the same preprocessing and model on the datasets with $\Delta$ = 3 and 4 respectively.</p>
### 3.3 Test Set
Three ways to choose test set:</p>
1. All users and all items:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/Test_Set_Selection_1.png)
2. Users who have certain behaviors and the items that users has interactions with in the two days before :
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/Test_Set_Selection_2.png)
3. For each user who was active before, only condider the items that he has interactions with:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/Test_Set_Selection_3.png" height="330" width="450"/>
</div>

### 3.4 Train Set
The basic rules all the same for train set. Two things to consider:</p>
1. As customary, we set the ratio between the training set and the test set to be 4:1. So since we have choose **(16, 17 → 18)** as the test set (before '→', the features of test set; after '→', the labels of the test set), we need to choose another four groups.
2. If we count back from 18th, the abnormal comsumption in 12th, December will distrurb our model greatly, so we need to skip that when choose the train set.

The overall process is shown below, and related data that has been processed is in our [Data](https://github.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/tree/master/Data) folder.

## 4. Feature Generating
All the features can be dicided into two levels:
1. Basic features, which usually involve one indicator in the original file;
2. Interactive features, which involve two or more original indicators.

And for each feature class, like user features, the features it contains can be divided into three types:
1. Satistic features: Obtained by directly counting the number of certain event.
2. Ratio features: Ratio between two satistic features.
3. Time features: Features that involve time.

**Note**: some ratio-based indicators in this article have missing indicator data because the denominator is 0. For such indicators, the missing value is filled with 0.

## 5. Data preprocessing
### 5.1 Dealing with missing data
Since our features all extracted from  the original data, the missing features have already filled up during the generating process.
### 5.2 Standardization
In order to eliminate the model result error caused by the size of the data itself, we standardize the data.

<div align="center">
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\x_{i}^{'}=\frac{x_{i}-\mu}{\sigma}"/>
</div>

### 5.3 Imbalanced Sample: Up&downsampling
Through statistics, we have a total of 279,525 samples, while the number of samples with the "label=1"(**'Purchase'**) is only 1,529. The ratio of samples with "label=1" and 'label=0' is around 1:190. In order to eliminate the impact of data imbance on the model results, we upscaled the data with "label=1" and also downscaled the data with "label=0" in the training set. In the end, the ratio of samples with "label=1" and "label=0" is around 1:10.</p>
The downsampling process will affect the metrics we choose, because we found that the accuracy rate of the model on the training set can be seriously affected. So we will choose **precision**, **recall** and **F1** as our metircs. 

## 6. Model Building
Since we would like to compare the results of using the first 2/3/4 days' data to predict the next day's purchase behavior, we use three series of data in each model below.
### 6.1 Beneficial Attempts
#### 6.1.1 Lasso + Logistic Regression</p>
We use L1 regularization to achieve variable selection. In order to reduce dimension, we gradually adjust the value of parameter "C" and there're finally 5 features selected, including:</p>
Features selected|Coefficient|Explanation
:---:|:---:|:---:
1_user activity|3.459e-04|The more active is the user, the more possible for him to buy.
1_number of items related|-2.85615479e-03|The fewer relating items the user interacts with, the more possible for him to buy this particular item.
1_time lag|-2.199e-02| Shorter the time lag between first and last time online, the more possible to buy， probably because the so called ‘consumption impulse’. When the user spends more time viewing the items, he may become more rational and find there’s no need to buy. 
2_item_view|-4.624e-04| The fewer relating items the user view, the more possible for him to buy this particular item.
4_geo_view|-9.380e-06| Contradict to our common sense-- larger the ratio of purchased product number to viewed product number in the area, the more possible to buy. However, as we can see in our model the coefficient is relatively small compared with other features.

(**Note**: Above results are based on the first 2 days' data. Using the first 3/4 days' data, we get excactly same features, and similiar coefficients.)

We use above five features for modeling and the results are as follows:</p>

Value|2-days|3-days|4-days
:-: | :------: | :------: | :------: 
Parameter C|0.0000065|0.0000085|0.0000050
Training accruacy|0.901|0.922|0.925
Test accruacy|0.617|0.589|0.667

The results are not satisfying:</p>
* We expect the "Interactive Features" to conduct a relatively large effect on purchase behavior, because they reflect the specific relation between the user and items. However, none of them is chosen in the model.</p>
* The testing accuracy is too low, so do F1-score&Precision&Recall under 5-folds cross-validation.

#### 6.1.2. PCA + Logistic Regression
After principle components analysis, we find the first principle component can explain nearly all of the variance in the model (99.95% in 2-days data). PCA reflects that our data have serious multicollinearity problem. Here's the structure of the first component in 2-days data.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/PCA.png" />
</div>
As we can see, except for "4_geo_view", which make up 99.15% in the first component, other features only make up a very small poportion (based on 2-days data, other series of data get similiar results).
Afterwards, we apply Logistic Regression to the first component and get following results.</p>

Value|2-days|3-days|4-days
:-: | :------: | :------: | :------: 
Training accruacy|0.901|0.922|0.925
Test accruacy|0.995|0.996|0.996

We get test accruacy much higher than training, which does not make sense. Checking the confusion matrix, we find the True Positive Rate is really low, that is to say this method tends to classify all the observations into Negative, thus resulting the high test accruacy since the buying behavior is so rare.

The above two methods may not have a good performance considering prediction, however, we get a better understanding of our data through them. Possible explanations for the so far unsatisfactory results:</p>
* Logestic Regression is not suitable for our data structure. We consider a large number of features , including large amount of dummy variables, the data structure may be complex, but Logestic Regression is basically a linear model. </p>
* Besides, reviewing the [Tianchi competition](https://www.csdn.net/article/2014-08-27/2821403-the-top-9-of-ali-bigdata-competition/4),it is widely acknowledged that the logistic regression model has a natural disadvantage compared with the random forest and GBRT for this dataset, which is consistent with our results.</p>

### 6.2 Practical Models
#### 6.2.1 Random Forest
As a bagging method, Random forest can efficiently help us alleviate overfitting problem, and sort out some important features, eg.'5_Number_of_purchasing', '5_Category_prefernce', '5_Category_purchase_power', '5_Overnight_purchase_pattern'.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/IF.png"/>
</div>
Through 5-folds cross-validation, we get the ROC curve (based on 2-days data):
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/ROC for RF.jpg"/>
</div>

Value|2-days|3-days|4-days
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
Training accruacy|0.9878|0.9895|0.9903
Test accruacy|0.9874|0.9902|0.9913
F1 Score|92.98%|92.72%|92.84%
precision|89.60%|89.44%|89.90%
recall|96.62%|96.25%|95.99%
 
We can tell from the results that 2-days data already have a good predicting performance, getting the highest F1 score of 92.98%. Confusion matrix for 2-days data is shown below:

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/CM for RF.png"/>
</div>

#### 6.2.2 GBRT (Gradient Boost Regression Tree)
GBRT adopts the idea of boosting, here are the results:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/ROC for GBC.jpg"/>
</div>

Value|2-days|3-days|4-days
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
Training accruacy|0.9625|0.9630|0.9607
Test accruacy|0.9821|0.9878|0.9889
F1 Score|80.11%|73.82%|67.68%
precision|83.53%|84.21%|83.41%
recall|76.96%|65.71%|56.94%

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parametric3/PHBS_MLF_2019/master/Figs/CM for GBC.png" />
</div>
We can see that the performance of GBRT is not as good as RF. Meanwhile, GBRT seems to have the best performance for latest data (2-days data).

## 7. Conclusion
### 7.1 Beneficial Attempts

Value|2-days Lasso+LR|3-days Lasso+LR|4-days Lasso+LR|2-days PCA+LR|3-days PCA+LR|4-days PCA+LR
:-: | :------: | :------: | :------:| :------: | :------: | :------: 
Training accruacy|0.901|0.922|0.925|0.901|0.922|0.925
Test accruacy|0.617|0.589|0.667|0.995|0.996|0.996

* Five features selected in Lasso+LR: **'1_user activity'**, **'1_number of items related'**, **'1_time lag'**, **'2_item_view'**, **'4_geo_view'**, and the coefficients are reasonable to explain. However, the test accuracy is too low.
* One principle component is chosen by PCA, which is mostly made up by **'4_geo_view'**. However, PCA+LR tends to classify all observations into negative.

### 7.2 Practical Models
Value|2-days RF|3-days RF|4-days RF|2-days GBRT|3-days GBRT|4-days GBRT
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
Training accruacy|0.9878|0.9895|0.9903|0.9625|0.9630|0.9607
Test accruacy|0.9874|0.9902|0.9913|0.9821|0.9878|0.9889
F1 Score|92.98%|92.72%|92.84%|80.11%|73.82%|67.68%
precision|89.60%|89.44%|89.90%|83.53%|84.21%|83.41%
recall|96.62%|96.25%|95.99%|76.96%|65.71%|56.94%

As far as we can see, Random Forest is a better method compared to GBRT, and 2-days data (92573 obs) outperform 3-days (136431 obs)
and 4-days (182077 obs) regarding F1-score. In a word, applying Random Forest to the lasted two days data is an efficient way to predict purchase behavior of today.

## Appendix
### Explanations for Professor's Comments
**Comment 1** :</p>
*In many models, test accuracy is significatly higher than training accuracy. (PCA+LR, SVM, RF, GBRT) The only result that makes sense to me is LASSO + LR. I think there is something wrong.* </p>
**Answer**:</p>
* We indeed get test accuracy much higher than training in some model, which does not make sense.</p>
* Checking the confusion matrix, we find the True Positive Rate is really low, that is to say this method tends to classify all the observations into Negative. As a result, the  **up & down sampling** method for only the training set instead of for both the training * and testing make a difference, leading to higher accuracy in testing set than in training one. </p>
* Besides, we think the accuracy ratio is not that important due to the extremely imbalanced samples (much more “Not Purchase” than “Purchase” samples) . As a matter of fact, the tianchi competition only focus on the F1 score.</p>

**Comment 2** :</p>
*What is the feature importance? What is the first two PCA factors meaning?*  </p>
**Answer**:</p>
* Modifying the code, we find only one important component **“4_geo_view”** in the current version, which makes up 99.15% in the first component while other features only make up a very small proportion (based on 2-days data, 3-days and 4-days data get similar results).</p>
* **4_geo_view** means the total number of items viewed in the area, which illustrates the important effect of geographical factors on consumption behaviors. However, this result also reflects that our data have serious multicollinearity problem and the first component by PCA doesn’t really make sense to some extent.</p>
